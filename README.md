## Overview
The **Digit Recognition Practice** project is designed to help users understand and implement digit recognition using machine learning and deep learning techniques. 
This project leverages popular libraries such as Numpy and Pytorch to build and train models that can accurately identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
## Features
- Implemented digit recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tatkien/Digit-Recognition-Practice.git
cd Digit-Recognition-Practice
```
## Dataset
This project uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images
